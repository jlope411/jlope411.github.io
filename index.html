	<h1>BIO</h1>
		<p><b>As an Technical Trainer,</b> I supported the Excalibur division of RCL creating a variety of learning content to meet their training needs. Met with teams and devised learning strategies and best practices for change management. Created training from scratch with little guidaince on tools functionality. Developed a 12-panel storyboard and led a pitch for a revamped Internship program. </p>
		<p><b>As an LMS Administrator,</b> I supported 55,000 students and faculty using our two LMS&rsquo;, troubleshot issues and contacted vendors daily. I developed a repository of SQL queries to pull data records for course activity and academic investigations.Took conference opportunities to provide live support, be an LMS resource, and build instructors confidence as we migrated over to a new LMS. I hosted trainings for instructors and new admins, going over LMS functionality as well as other tools largely used in the university. I headed development projects with multiple vendors, personally ensuring their tool was fully tested, documented, and implemented into our new LMS within the university deadline. </p>
		<p><b>As a Course Developer,</b> I improved educational curriculum and resolved issues in credit courses, while creating tool training guides and course initiatives for faculty. The role gave me a strong foundation on how to design and implement educational content for a diverse group of users. Created a fully automative librarian system through Google Scripts, and developed marketing material seen throughout campus and in our learning environments.</p>
